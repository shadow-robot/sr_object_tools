   *      "neighbor_edges"  stores the indices of edges corresponding to
   *                        adjacent vertices
   * 2. <EdgeT> is a struct storing the edge information. It must have members
   * "vtx1Id_" and "vtx2Id_" that hold the indices of the two vertices forming
   * an edge.
   *
   * Internally graph information is stored in two vectors: a vector of
   * <VertexT> and a vector of <EdgeT>. Vertex and edge indices correspond to
   * their positions in the vectors.
